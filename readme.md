🔍 Testing concept distinction...
   Can distinguish 'red' from 'blue': True (distance: 1.15)
   Can distinguish 'self' from 'consciousness': True (distance: 0.62)

💭 Thinking: 'self' → 'qualia'
   Step 1: 'awareness'
   Step 2: 'consciousness'
   Step 3: 'perception'
   Step 4: 'pleasure'
   🛑 No new concepts to explore

🤔 Meta-thinking about thought: self → awareness → consciousness...
